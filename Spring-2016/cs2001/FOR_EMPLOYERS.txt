This class, Contemporary Programming (cs2001), taught us the basic syntax of several languages.
Every two assignments, we switched to a new language. This helped solidify the understanding of
programming logic between languages, making learning new syntaxes very easy given that we know
how most languages tend to be made up. Another skill we learned here was unit testing, which was 
required for many of the early assignments, and encouraged for the later ones.

This repository is currently missing assignments 4 through 10.
This is because those assignments have a massive amount of files associated with them,
and GitHub is being a hassle with a file upload limit. I will work on getting the rest of the files
uploaded here. In the meantime, you can email me at cgpzbd@mst.edu if you would like to see the
files sooner.

This series at many times took a "fill in the blank" approach. Some assignments had the core flow
already pre-written by the instructors, and our job was to create the functionality for each
piece of code.
