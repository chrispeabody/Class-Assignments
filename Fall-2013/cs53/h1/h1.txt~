[Accidentally did these problems. Decided to save them because why not?]

Find the lexicographic difference of two words
1. Compare the first letters
  a. If they are the same, move to the next two letters, etc.
  b. If they are different, find their numerical values
2. Subtracts the numerical values and take the absolute values
  (Alternatively, find which is higher, and subtracts the higher from the
lower.)

Direct the robot through the maze
1. Sense if wall is in front
  a. If there is, turn left, back to step 1
  b. If there is not, go forward
2. Check if goal is reached
  a. If so, finish
  b. If not, back to step 1
(This will work assuming there are no portions that cause the robot to walk
forward, turn completely around, walk back, and turn completely around
again.)

Help the students find their ID's
1. Have one student pull an id out
  a. If it is theirs, they leave the class
  b. Otherwise, talk to a student to see if it is theirs
    i. If it is theirs, trade it to them, and they leave the class, go
       back to 1.
    ii. If it is not theirs, go back to b. and talk to a different student
2. Once there are not more students to pull id's out, then it's all done!

(This was done assuming the students could not have just looked at the name
on the id and given it to who owns it.)
