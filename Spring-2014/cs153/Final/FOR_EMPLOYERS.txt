My main programming class for Spring 2014 was Data Structures (cs153 at the time).
In this class we used C++ to impliment certain data structures from the ground up. The various assignments
will typically say which data structure it's implimenting in the title. 

The backup folder appears to have been for temporary use, I believe those same files are replicated
elsewhere in this class section.
