This class is Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms (cs5401).

I am quite proud of the work in this class. This was the first time I created really extensive programs
for an assignment using python. This class helped me learn the language. In later classes, you can
easily see how my python skills have grown. In this class, I wrote most of my assignments using one
main .py file, which got cluttered. In later classes, particularly AI, I began structuring my files better
for readability.

Aside from that, these programs work very well, and are extremely complex. Perfect for showcasing some of the 
abilities I've picked up from this class. In the first assignment series, we created a SAT-Solver EA. In the second
assignment series, we created very simple "AI's" for pacman, and eventually ghosts, to compete in games.

All the assignments have a nice file structure for input files, configuration files, output/log files, and statistical
analysis. Each of these things became progressively more complex as each assignment series continued.
