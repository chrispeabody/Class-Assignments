These classes are currently on-going, and I plan to add in assignments as we complete them.

We have Artificial Intelligence (cs5400), and Intro to Operating Systems (3800).

Operating systems is relatively light on programming, so not many assignments will be uploaded for that series.
However, Artificial Intelligence is quite heavy on assignments, so you should be able to expect many more to come.
The coding done in AI is a good reflection of how I have improved in using Python, especially when it comes
to code structure and efficiency. You can see effeciency changes between each assignment very cleary. 
The first assignments, 1-4, improve and change drastically from file to file, improving efficiency and clarity.
