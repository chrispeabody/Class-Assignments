Sokoban A* Graph Search Solver!

In order to run the solver use the command:

python sokoban.py [puzzlepath]

Where [puzzlepath] is the file path FROM where you're running the program TO where the puzzle file is. The puzzle should be in the 'inst' folder which is in the same directory as the program. The puzzle file must be a .cfg format. The solution will be in the 'sol' folder in the same directory a the program.

Alternatively you can leave off the [puzzlepath] arguement, in which case you will have to enter it in the program.

THIS PROGRAM IS RUNNING IN PYTHON 3.5!!! IF 3.5 IS NOT THE DEFAULT PYTHON VERSION ON YOUR MACHINE, USE THE NECESSARY COMMAND TO RUN IT WITH 3.5 RATHER THAN YOUR VERSION!!!

Note: Puzzles labeled with a letter, i.e. puzzleA.cfg are for my own testing purposes. The solution files are included. They are just extra puzzles which were solved.
