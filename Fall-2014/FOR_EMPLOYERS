These classes, Algorthims (cs2500) and Databases (cs2300) were relatively light on programming.
Most of the class grades came from homework we turned in in class. The Databases assignment here was a mock-up
program rather than an actual implimentation, and was built primarily as a proof of concept rather than
a functional piece.
